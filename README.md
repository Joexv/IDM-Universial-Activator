# IDM-Universial-Activator

As any good pirate should, I decided to help contribute by making a patch to create or change an existing license for IDM via the registry.

### How does it work?

It simply take the values entered into the fields and creates 3 key/value pairs (FName, LName and Serial) then injects these into the registry under IDM.

### Instructions

1) Download and install IDM.

2) Open "IDM Universial Activator\Resources" folder, copy IDMan.exe to IDM install location

3) Inside the "IDM Universial Activator\bin" folder and run "IDM Universial Activator.exe"

4) Enter in desired license details

5) Click "Patch"

### Notice

This may still be buggy but there may still be some that I have not caught. If you find any please let me know.

**IDMan.exe is sourced from Team Reis and is NOT my creation. The reason for this is because I dont know enough assembly to comfortably modify DLL's on my own**.

### Extras

Please feel free to copy this and modify it if you like.
