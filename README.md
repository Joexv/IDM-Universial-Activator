# IDM-Universial-Activator

As any good pirate should, I decided to help contribute by making a patch to create or change an existing license for IDM via the registry.

### Notice

This may still be buggy but there may still be some that I have not caught. If you find any please let me know.

**IDMan.exe is sourced from Team Reis and is NOT my creation. The reason for this is because I dont know enough assembly to comfortably modify DLL's on my own**.

### How does it work?

It a license object made up of 3 key/value pairs (FName, LName and Serial) then injects these into the registry under IDM.

### Instructions

1) Download and install IDM.

2) Open "Latest Release" folder and copy IDMan.exe to IDM install location

3) Run "IDM Universial Activator.exe" to set the create a license and activate IDM
