# IDM-Universial-Activator

As any good pirate should, I decided to help contribute by making a patch to create a license for IDM.

### How does it work?

it simply take the values entered into the fields and creates 3 key/value pairs (FName, LName and Serial) then injects these into the registry under IDM.

### Instructions

1) Download and install IDM.

2) Open "build" folder and copy IDMan.exe to install path

3) Inside the "build" folder run IDM Universial Activator.exe

4) IDM should now be patched.

### Notice

This may still be buggy but there may still be some that I have not caught. If you find any please let me know.

### Extras

Please feel free to copy this and modify it if you like.
